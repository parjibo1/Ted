<p>Wonseh Mulbah
  Group President & Chief Executive
  Wonseh Mulbah is the founder and president/chief executive of 
  the Ted & Associates Group of Companies which is a network of a group of companies 
  that provide need-sensitive services to clients/customers. This network started with 
  Engineering and Construction which is still in business now. The network hopes to establish
   other subgroups in addition to the one that is currently active with more funding and investors
    being involved. This is the motivation of the CEO “A Pastor called Bishop Dr. David G. W. Badio was 
    advising his son and out of curiosity, I stopped by to know the conversation. Through that, he inspired 
    me to believe in myself and the importance of group contribution. This inspiration ignited a passion to start
     my company despite the challenges at the time” said Mr. Mulbah. He invested a lot of thought into this dream 
     company since he was a student in the Department of Civil Engineering, University of Liberia. When he was a senior 
     student during his undergraduate studies, he gathered other like-minded young and innovative individuals to start 
     up the company in January 2020. The company was established to provide a reliable brand that people can trust and 
     through said quality and effective service will be able to build a company of national, regional, and global relevance.</p>
